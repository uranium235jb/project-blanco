Project Blanco: Building a Home Lab for Cloud & IT Skills Development

This document details the foundational build of "Project Blanco," a personal home lab designed to provide hands-on experience in virtualization, Linux administration, networking, and self-hosting. This project directly supports my academic pursuits in Cloud Computing and aims to develop practical, real-world IT skills.

Key Technologies Utilized:

•	Hypervisor: Proxmox VE 8.x (Debian Linux-based)

•	Hardware: Intel N100 Mini PC (Firebat) with 16GB RAM, 512GB NVMe SSD

•	Guest Operating System: Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS

•	Networking: Ethernet, DHCP, Static IP Configuration, Subnetting

•	Remote Access: Secure Shell (SSH)

Key Outcomes Achieved (Phase 1: Foundation):
•	Successful bare-metal deployment of Proxmox VE on dedicated mini PC hardware.

•	Robust network configuration and troubleshooting, ensuring stable connectivity for the hypervisor and virtual machines.

•	Deployment and initial configuration of a foundational Linux virtual machine (ubuntu-practice), ready for hosting various services.

•	Established secure remote access to the Linux VM via SSH from both laptop and mobile devices.

Skills Demonstrated:
•	Hardware Selection & Setup

•	Operating System Installation (Hypervisor & Guest OS)

•	Network Configuration & Troubleshooting (including subnet conflicts and static IP assignment)

•	Linux Command Line Administration (e.g., nano, apt, ip a)

•	Virtual Machine Management (creation, configuration, lifecycle)

•	Problem Solving & Debugging (systematic approach to network and repository issues)

•	Technical Documentation (ongoing)
